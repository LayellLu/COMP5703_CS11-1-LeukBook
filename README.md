## Brief Introduction of Project

In the current fashion market where most of the clothing is under 14, female consumers who wear a 14+ are neglected, which makes them feel out of fashion and also difficult to buy suitable clothing. LeukBook has provided these consumers with a one-stop fashion platform that gather some excellent plus-sizewomen's clothingbrands.

So this project aims to build a PoC of the “Fit tech” to help these consumers to get the size recommendation for clothing from different brandsand quickly get the best fitting clothes.
